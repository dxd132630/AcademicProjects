Big Data HW2 README:

1. Submitted by: dxd132630 Name: deepti deshpande
2. The submission file contains :
   1. dxd132630HW2.jar file
   2. README.txt
   3. RedSideJoin.java class file for PART1
   4. mapSideJoin.java class file for PART2

Contents of JAR file and the execution details:
1. The JAR file contains all the necessary BUILD libraries
2. Two class files for each part of the question respectively:
    1. RedSideJoin.java : This Class file is the implementation of the Reduce-side join for HW1 part 1.
       Reduce side join implementaions to find the top 5 avergae rated  movies and their titles by Women.
	User.dat file is read from the distributed cache and the ratings.dat is read by one mapper and map-side join is performed on the two files to get the movieid, userid and rating of those movies that are rated by female users. Then reduce-side join is performed with the movies.dat file to get the respective movie titles and the reducer emits the average ratings and the movie titles by joining the two files. Second join in the job chain reads the file from the intermediate output location in the mapper pahse. The reducer receives the key as average and values as the titles which have the same averages are grouped, then the reducer just lists the top 5 movies.
       
	Note: put the users.dat file in the Distributed location and add the path in the RedSideJoin.java file.
       Command to execute the class file :
	hadoop jar <path_to_Jar_dir>/dxd132630HW2.jar RedSideJoin rating movie output
	Where rating is the DFS location of ratings.dat file, movies is the DFS location of movies.dat file and output are dfs locations for output file.

       Expected output : Titles of top 5 average movies rated by female users.

    2. mapSideJoin.java :This class file is the implementation of the Map-side(Replicated Join) function for HW2 part 2
        The class reads one file from distributed cache(users.dat file) and the other file in the mapper phase and performs a Map-side join.
	The class has no implementation of reducer function.
   
        Command to execute the class file:
      
        hadoop jar <path_to_Jar_dir>/dxd132630HW2.jar mapSideJoin rating ouput
	Note: put the users.dat file in the Distributed location and add the path in the RedSideJoin.java file.
	
	Expected output : Distributes Cache-users.dat, ratings.dat
